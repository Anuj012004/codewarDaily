//  TO DO

// Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a filtered list containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

// The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

//   ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]

// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

//  ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]

// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]

//Solution

function gooseFilter (birds) {
    var geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
    
    // return an array containing all of the strings in the input array except those that match strings in geese
    let result = []
    for(let x of birds){
      if(!geese.includes(x)){
        result.push(x)
      }
    }
    return result
  };
